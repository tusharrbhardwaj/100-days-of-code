# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: April 05, 2025

**Today's Progress**: learnt some basic CLI commands and basics of internet and web applications.

**Thoughts:** Though the process was smooth because of the curriculam I'm following ie the Odin Project but currently I'm stuggling with the habit of watching videos and learning stuffs. Reading and learning is not my cup of tea though I tried my best and working to overcome it soon.

**Link to work:** No link
