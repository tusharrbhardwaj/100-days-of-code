# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: April 05, 2025

**Today's Progress**: learnt some basic CLI commands and basics of internet and web applications.

**Thoughts:** Though the process was smooth because of the curriculam I'm following ie the Odin Project but currently I'm stuggling with the habit of watching videos and learning stuffs. Reading and learning is not my cup of tea though I tried my best and working to overcome it soon.

Day 01: April 06, 2025

**Today's Progress**: learnt some more basic CLI commands, navigation through files & directories and file & direcotry handling and got to setup git. Learn to set up SSH keys and github.

**Thoughts:** The process of reading a learning from your mind and then implementing the same on your computer is a bit hard process which requires a lot more energy than it seems to be. Though I am having fun while learning, but it sometimes feel overwhelming cause there is lot to learn and a lot that I forgot.
