# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: April 05, 2025

**Today's Progress**: learnt some basic CLI commands and basics of internet and web applications.

**Thoughts:** Though the process was smooth because of the curriculam I'm following ie the Odin Project but currently I'm stuggling with the habit of watching videos and learning stuffs. Reading and learning is not my cup of tea though I tried my best and working to overcome it soon.

Day 01: April 06, 2025

**Today's Progress**: learnt some more basic CLI commands, navigation through files & directories and file & direcotry handling and got to setup git. Learn to set up SSH keys and github.

**Thoughts:** The process of reading a learning from your mind and then implementing the same on your computer is a bit hard process which requires a lot more energy than it seems to be. Though I am having fun while learning, but it sometimes feel overwhelming cause there is lot to learn and a lot that I forgot.

Day 02: April 07, 2025

**Today's Progress**: But my hands on git Commands and their compatibility with Github and its main feature ie Version control. I did set my "git commit -m" Command's text editor to VS code so that every time I type git commit and hit enter, I am redirected to VS code for the commit message I want to make. Started the introduction To HTML and CSS. A few things I knew already, but learnt the individual meanings of HTML boilerplate.

**Thoughts:**  Today's Task and progress was comparatively easier than the other two days. Though I am still struggling with read and learnt method, but I am working to get better at it.

Day 03: April 08, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Today was the day when I learned more tags Related to HTML, which includes
"<strong> <em> <a>" Also, the concept of "noopener" and "noreferrer" It's quite clear in my mind. I've learnt the Target ie The tab where to open the new link. A default target is "_self" However, we can set it to how it pleases us to set it to new blank tab or window we can use "_blank".

**Thoughts:**  As I am getting more familiar with read and learn method, I am starting to like it. Though today was the day, I was very tired because of traveling, but I made enough time and efforts to not break my 100daysofcode
